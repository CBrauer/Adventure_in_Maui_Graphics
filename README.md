# Adventure_in_Maui_Graphics
This Repo shows how to use Maui Graphics to develop 2D charts and meters.

At this time, the application is developed as a Windows Form App, using .NET Core 6, and a
pre-release of Maui Graphics, and a pre-release of Visual Studio (Version 17.3.0 Preview 1.1).

Here is a screen capture of the running program:

Please resize the form to see the redraw speed of Maui Graphics.

Enjoy.
