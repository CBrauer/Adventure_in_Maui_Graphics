# Adventure_in_Maui_Graphics
This Repo shows how to use Maui Graphics to develop charts and meters.

At this time, the App is developed as a Windows Form, using .NET Core 6, and a
pre-release of Maui Graphics.

Here is a screen capture of the running program:

Please resize the form to see the redraw speed of Maui Graphics.

Any comment will be greatly appreciated.
